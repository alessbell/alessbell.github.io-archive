<h1>About Alessia</h1>

<p>Hi, I&#39;m Alessia Bellisario. I&#39;m a recent graduate of <a href="http://www.trinity.utoronto.ca/">Trinity College</a> in the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a> with a degree in Ethics, Society &amp; Law  and a member of the <a href="http://bitmakerlabs.com/">Bitmaker Labs</a> June 2014 full-stack development cohort where I learned to make things with Ruby on Rails + JavaScript. I love politics and &lt;3 the web.</p>

<p>Outside of my studies, I served as founding member and chair of a grant- and award-winning educational not-for-profit, The University of Toronto Model Parliament and Youth Leadership Seminar, an annual model provincial parliament at Queen&#39;s Park bringing together over two hundred high school and university students from across Canada. In the summers of 2012 and 2013, I worked as special assistant to Toronto city councillor <a href="http://johnfilion.ca">John Filion</a> on several web-based initiatives.</p>

<p>I hope to use this tiny piece of digital real estate to post occasional code snippets and more generally document the life of a recent grad venturing into the world of full-stack web development. Thanks for stopping by :)</p>
