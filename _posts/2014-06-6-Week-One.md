# Code and Camaraderie

Week one at Bitmaker Labs is quickly drawing to a close. It is 7:01 EST and eight students of a cohort of thirty-five remain: those of us still making our way through coding challenges and a few kind classmates willing to stick it out on a Friday night to lend a helping hand. Bitmaker co-founder Will Richman has been quietly typing away at a desk among students and instructors doing much of the same, but the room is a bit too quiet for a Friday night. Will swivels around in his chair: “Anyone want a beer? Maybe some music?”

New Order’s “Bizarre Love Triangle” plays on the stereo as bottles of Keith’s are handed out. The group that remains is in for the long haul (those who’ve headed out for the weekend have long since completed the assignment due Monday), but at Bitmaker, camaraderie—and Songza—are the perfect complements to a long day of hard work. It’s only the first week but nearly everyone is talking about coming in on Saturday for more of the same.

I could write a few hundred words on the attendant highs and lows of week one, but, frankly, I have code that needs refactoring. The intellectual roller coaster ride that is learning to program is equal parts exhilarating and exhausting, but the satisfaction of writing a working command line CRM program is unlike anything I’ve experienced. With week one in the books, there is much to look forward to: in week two, we’ll be building our first web application and learning more about the inner workings of the web. Stay tuned for more dispatches from 220 King Street West.
