Having signed up for the June cohort in December, I had a few months to work on the Bitmaker prep course which consists mainly of the Codecademy Ruby track, Ruby Monk, the Command Line Crash Course and a primer on Git and HTML/CSS. The material was easy enough to get through the first time, but when it came to internalizing a whole host of new concepts in a short period of time, I knew I needed a better strategy. Eventually, I came across a few incredibly helpful articles on spaced repetition learning + programming that you can read [here](https://medium.com/medium-redef/5481606b087a), [here](http://sivers.org/srs), [here](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm), [here](http://www.jackkinsella.ie/2011/12/05/janki-method.html) and [here](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm). I also found some of the books mentioned [here on Chris Webb's blog](http://blog.mediumequalsmessage.com/6-best-learning-ruby-books) to be quite useful, and found [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) to be invaluable, as well.

Most of the articles on spaced repetition learning mentioned above refer to a free flash card program called Anki to reinforce concepts/improve retention. Using the a few lists of questions I came across on The Odin Project, I made a few decks of flash cards on:

- [Arrays](https://github.com/alessbell/alessbell.github.io/blob/master/flash%20cards/Arrays.apkg?raw=true)
- [Hashes](https://github.com/alessbell/alessbell.github.io/blob/master/flash%20cards/Hashes.apkg?raw=true)
- [Numbers](https://github.com/alessbell/alessbell.github.io/blob/master/flash%20cards/Numbers.apkg?raw=true)
- [Strings](https://github.com/alessbell/alessbell.github.io/blob/master/flash%20cards/Strings.apkg?raw=true)

You can download Anki [here](http://ankisrs.net/) and my flash card files can be downloaded from the links above. Which coding resources do you find particularly helpful? Drop me a line at <bellisario.alessia@gmail.com> or [@alessbell](http://twitter.com/alessbell)!
