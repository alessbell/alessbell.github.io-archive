It's been more than five months since I first stepped foot in Bitmaker Labs' old office space on Duncan Street for my interview. At the time, I was parsing through college curricula for programs in interaction design/development, contemplating the LSAT and facing down a daunting fork in the road as my final semester at the University of Toronto drew near. Deciding on a single path post-graduation was predictably tough: on the one hand, I've deeply enjoyed the course work I've completed over the past few years in political theory and ethics. On the other hand, I'm all too familiar with the Jessica Hische-ism "procrastiwork," n., meaning "the work you do when you should be doing other work." As a staffer at city hall (during the infamous Summer of Crack, no less), I happily took on a compendium of duties that fell under the umbrella of digital communications, but eventually the urge to build new and better tools outgrew my job description and fledgling skill set.

Before I seriously considered Bitmaker Labs, I began exploring a range of free or inexpensive online options: One Month Rails and Codecademy would manage to keep me occupied for a day or two at a time but I quickly realized that, while a primer in Ruby on Rails was a great start, I was seeking a more robust, intensive training in the web development.
