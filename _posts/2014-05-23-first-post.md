It's been more than five months since I first stepped foot in the old Bitmaker Labs' office space on Duncan Street for my interview with Erik and Minh. At the time, I was parsing through college curricula for programs in interaction design/development, contemplating the LSAT and facing down a daunting fork in the road as my final semester at the University of Toronto drew near.

Deciding on a single path post-graduation was predictably tough: on the one hand, I've thoroughly enjoyed the course of studies I've completed over the past few years in political theory and ethics. On the other hand, I'm all too familiar with the Jessica Hische-ism "[procrastiwork](http://jessicahische.is/aprocrastiworker)": my first freelance web design client was my dad's small business. I was in high school. Throughout undergrad, the freelance web design/photography work I took on became affectionately known as "the work I do when I should be doing other work." It took a few years of growth and self-reflection to finally realize that my innate impulse to create things on the web is in fact a feature, not a bug, of my personal and professional interests.

As a political staffer at city hall (during the infamous Summer of Crack, no less), I happily took on a compendium of duties that fell under the umbrella of digital communications, but eventually the urge to build new and better tools outgrew my job description and fledgling skill set. Before I seriously considered Bitmaker Labs, I began exploring a range of free or inexpensive online options: One Month Rails and Codecademy would manage to keep me occupied for a day or two at a time but I quickly realized that, while a primer in Ruby on Rails was a great start, I was seeking a more robust program.

## Enter Bitmaker Labs

I'll spare you my own explanation of coding bootcamps and their relative merits; [Quora](http://www.quora.com/Programming-Bootcamps/Are-programming-boot-camps-worth-it) and [Hacker News](http://eewang.github.io/blog/2013/10/17/are-dev-bootcamps-a-scam-an-alums-perspective/) are equally good places to begin your research if you're considering a similar program. The important point, however, seems to me to be this: seeing as a coding bootcamp essentially provides you with a wealth of educational resources and an relatively brief block of time in which to take advantage of them, a person's relative success is essentially a function of effort and effective use of time.

## "Practice makes permanent. Perfect practice makes perfect."

Having signed up for the June cohort in December, I had a few months to work on the Bitmaker prep course which consists mainly of the Codecademy Ruby track, Ruby Monk, the Command Line Crash Course and a primer on Git and HTML/CSS. The material was easy enough to get through the first time, but when it came to internalizing a whole host of new concepts in a short period of time, I knew I needed a better strategy. Eventually, I came across a few incredibly helpful articles on spaced repetition learning + programming that you can read [here](https://medium.com/medium-redef/5481606b087a), [here](http://sivers.org/srs), [here](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm), [here](http://www.jackkinsella.ie/2011/12/05/janki-method.html) and [here](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm). I also found some of the books mentioned [here on Chris Webb's blog](http://blog.mediumequalsmessage.com/6-best-learning-ruby-books) to be quite useful, and found [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) to be invaluable, as well.

Most of the articles on spaced repetition learning mentioned above refer to a free flash card program called Anki to reinforce concepts/improve retention. Using the a few lists of questions I came across on The Odin Project, I made a few decks of flash cards on:

- [Arrays](flash cards/Arrays.apkg)
- Hashes
- Numbers
- Strings

You can download Anki here and my flash card files above. Which resources do you find particularly helpful? Drop me a line at bellisario.alessia@gmail.com or @alessbell :) Happy programming!
