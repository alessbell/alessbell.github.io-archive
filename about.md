# About Alessia

Hi, I'm Alessia Bellisario. I'm a recent graduate of [Trinity College](http://www.trinity.utoronto.ca/) in the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/) with a degree in Ethics, Society & Law  and a member of the [Bitmaker Labs](http://bitmakerlabs.com/) June 2014 full-stack development cohort where I learned to make things with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. I love politics and <3 the web.

Outside of my studies, I served as founding member and chair of a grant- and award-winning educational not-for-profit, The University of Toronto Model Parliament and Youth Leadership Seminar, an annual model provincial parliament at Queen's Park bringing together over two hundred high school and university students from across Canada. In the summers of 2012 and 2013, I worked as special assistant to Toronto city councillor [John Filion](http://johnfilion.ca) on several web-based initiatives.

I hope to use this tiny piece of digital real estate to post occasional code snippets and more generally document the life of a recent grad venturing into the world of full-stack web development. Thanks for stopping by :)
