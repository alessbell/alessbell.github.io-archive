Hi, I'm Alessia Bellisario. I'm a recent graduate of [Trinity College](http://www.trinity.utoronto.ca/) in the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/) with a degree in Ethics, Society & Law  and a soon-to-be member of the [Bitmaker Labs](http://bitmakerlabs.com/) June 2014 full-stack development cohort. I love tech, politics, education and any cause or company that manages to combine any of the above. 

I hope to use this tiny piece of digital real estate to track my Bitmaker progress, post occasional code snippets and more generally document the life of a recent grad venturing into the world of full-stack web development.

If you'd like to chat or find yourself in Toronto and enjoy a good cup of coffee, feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter at <bellisario.alessia@gmail.com> or [@alessbell](http://twitter.com/alessbell).
