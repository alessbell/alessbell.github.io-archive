Hi, I'm Alessia Bellisario. I'm a recent graduate of the University of Toronto's Ethics, Society & Law program and a soon-to-be member of the Bitmaker Labs June 2014 full-stack development cohort. I love tech, politics, education and any cause or company that manages to combine any/all of the above. 

I hope to use this tiny piece of digital real estate to track my Bitmaker progress, post occasional code snippets and more generally document the life of a recent grad venturing into the world of full-stack web development.

If you'd like to chat or find yourself in Toronto and enjoy a good cup of coffee, feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter at bellisario[dot]alessia[at]gmail[dot]com or @alessbell.
